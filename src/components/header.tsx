            <p className="mt-10">
                The 1p Challenge is a way to save money by putting away a small
                amount each day. The ideas is that you will increase the amount
                you save by 1p each day. For example, on day 1 you save 1p, on
                day 2 you save 2p, on day 3 you save 3p and so on. By the end of
                the year you will have saved Â£667.95 (after 365 days).
